##  Usage
<!--
Call this document class with `\documentclass{academic_cv}`. It takes the following options (currently):
* `draft` - which builds the document with double spacing, an extra margin for notes, and allows three kinds of notes.
* `nonotes` which disables notes, but preserves spacing and geometry choices.
* `final` which single spaces, collapses lists, and makes standard 1 inch margins. 

Allowed notes in `draft` mode are:
* `\cnote{}` which inputs a grey highlighted text reading 'citation needed:yourtexthere'
* `\pnote{}` which inputs a yellow highlighted text with a note for yourself in it.
* `\mnote{}{}` which highlights text in the first braces grey, then puts in a margin note that contains text in the second braces, and connects the two with a grey line. -->
